THE AENEID. Boot< IV.

Tur subject os the Fourth Book has made it the most attractive,
perhaps the most celebrated, part os the poem: it has provoked much
controversy, and that ol a kind which has an interest, not only sor the
scholar, but sor the general reader, much of it has been supposed to
be borrowed from Apollonius Rhodius, whose work happens to be
preserved: it is the most dramatic portion os the Aeneid, and as such
may he viewed in relation to the masterpieces of Greek dramatic art.

According to the most detailed accounts, as epitomized in the Dic·
tionary of Biography, Dido's early history up to the time os her land-
ing in Africa coincides substautially with that narrated by Venus to
Aeneas in Book 1.; afterwards she is persecuted by her neighbor,
King Iarbas, who demands her hand, resolves to avoid him by death,
erects a sunpral pile under the pretence ol a sacrifice to propitiate her
former husband, and kills herself there. Virgil turns the loveless
queen into a passionate lover, keeping, however, the groundwork oi
the character, devotion to the memory os her murdered lord‚ which
isonly overcome by Venus's express agency, and even then from
tirno to time struggles and resists. Iarbas is naturally made to recede
into the distance ; his anger contributes to darken the prospect oi
Dido‘s desolation, but is in no sense the motive cause os her death
The mode os her death is borrowed from the traditional story, and
the lact oi her resorting to a pretext to conceal her purpose ; butas
the reason for her death is different, the pretext is different also. In
filling up the picture which he has sketched Virgil is indebted partly
to Apollonius, partly perhaps to the Ajax of Sophocles.

Virgil’s power is nowhere rnore conspicuously shown than in the
lines describing the horrors which drive Dido to her fatal purpose
