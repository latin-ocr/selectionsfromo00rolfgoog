ARGUMENT.

Troy, according to the almost universal tradition, was taken in the
summer. The winter os this year, which counts as the first ol the
seven, is spent by Aeneas in making preparatione (1 -7). He sails
iu the spring or summer os the second year (8- 12), and spends the
winter in Thrace, where he builds a city (13-18). The tragedy of
Polydorus drives him away in the spring of the third year (19-69).
He goes to Delos, and thence to Crete. Two years are supposed to
be consumed in his unfortunate attempt at colonizatiou. His stay at
Actium brings him to the end oi the fifth year (70- 284). The sixth
yearis spent partly in Epirus, partly in Sicily. In the summer os the
seventh he arrives at Carthage (Ι. 755). The remainder of the Book
(285-715) embraces the incidents us the sixth year, and os the seventh
up to the time of the arrival
