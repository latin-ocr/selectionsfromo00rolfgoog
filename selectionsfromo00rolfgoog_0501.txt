year old, has a set of eight primary or milk teeth : the two central os
these eight teeth then drop out, and are replaced by the first two
teeth os the second or permanent set, which being very large and con·
spicuous among the six remaining milk teeth, the animal at first sight
appears to have only tvvo teeth; hence the appellation bidens: lit
two-toothed. At the end os the second year, two more ol the milk
teeth drop, and are replaced by two large permanent teeth‚ one on
each side of the first two. The animal is therefore 110 longer haitans.
