THE ure ΟΡ VIRGIL 431

road (Via Puteolana) from Naples to Puteoli (Pozzuoli), between the
first and second milestones from N aples. The monument now called
the tomb of Virgil is not on the road which passes through the tun·
nel of Posilipp03 but if theJVia4 Puteolana ascended the hill of Posilip·
po, as it may have done, the situation of the monument would agree
very well with the description of Donatus

The following inscription is s'aid to have been placed on the tomb:

Mantua rne genuit, Calabri rapuere. tenet nunc
.. Ι ¹Parthenope. Cee'ni pascua, rura, duoes
From internal evidence it is improbable that it was written by the

poet, though Donatus says that it was.

Virgil named as heredes in his testament his half—brother, Valerius
Ptoculus to whom he left one half of his estate, and also Augustus,
Maecenas, L,Varius, and Plotius Tucca. The poet had been en·
riched hythe liberality of his patrons, ¹and he left behind him a con·
siderahle property, and a house on the Esquiline Hill near the ffr-
dens ef Maecenas. He used his wealth liberally‚ and his lihtary‚
which was doubtless a good one, was easy of access· He used to
send hie parents money every year. His father, who hemme blinds
did not die before his son had attained a mature age. Two litothera
d virgil also died before him. Poetry was not the only ntndyrof
virgil: he applied himself to medicine and to agriculture, as the
&agneo show; and also to what Donatus calls Marmarica, per·
haps a jnmble of astrology and astronomy. His stature was tall, his
complexion durh, and his appearance that of a rustic He was mod-
est end nothing, and his character is free from reproach‚ if we ex-
oept one scandalous passage in Donatus, which may not tell the truste

ln his fortrmes and his friends Virgil was a happy man mirificant
patiumg'e gave him ample means of enjoyment and of irrisore, and he
had the fn‘endship of all the most aecomplished men of the day,
nug whom Horace entertained astrong affection for hina He was
