the cave of the Cyclops, but landed on the shore, and so may be said
to have known it. So they did not actually pass Scylla, but they
came near enough to be in danger-204 Discrimina rerum:

referred to here, on the ground that the Manes were supposed to hear
the inclamatio. Henry may be right in going further, and supposing
the words to mean that the conclamatio, which, as he observes, was
originally a means of ascertaining whether a person was really dead,
actually takes place. —220. Cf VI. ryd Oronti. Gr. 69, Ere
