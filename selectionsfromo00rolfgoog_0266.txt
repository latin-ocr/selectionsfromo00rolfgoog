The life of Ovid‚ like that of most literary men, exhibits few prom·
inent incidents. From himself we learn that he was thrice married.
His first marriage took place when he was very young, andwas soon
dissolved as a low and unworthy connection. «His second wife was
also divorced‚ though he makes no charge against her. The third, to
whom he seems to have been tenderly attached, remained with him
until his banishment, in which she was forbidden by Augustus to ac-
company him He studied at Athens, as was customary with the
young men of his time. He held the judicial offices of triumvir, of
centumvir, and of decemvir. Till his fiftieth year, he continued to
reside at Rome, where he had a house near the Capitoh He not

’ only enjoyed the friendship of a large circle of distinguished men,

but was honored with the favor os Augustus and the imperial family.

Meanwhile he had given to the world the second edition of the
Amores ,· the Heroides, in which the most tragic love-stories of an·
cient legend are versified under the form of epistles; atragedy, Medea,
only two lines of which have come down to us, but which was esteemed
by contemporary critics as his masterpiece; the Ars A matonis, or De
Arte Amandi; the Remedia Amorz's ; and some minor' poems. He
had been engaged for some ten years on his great work, the Meta· ,
morphoser, which was nearly ready for publication. He had collected
the materials for the Fasti, a poetical version of the pontifical ritual,
aud may have made some progress in the composition of that work.
While thus engaged, he was suddenly commanded by an imperial
edict to transport himself to Tomi, a town on the Euxine, near the
mouth of the Danube, on the very frontiers of the empire A few
hours only were allowed him to prepare for the journey which was to
remove him forever from his home, his friends, and his family. He
was exiled, unheard and unarraigned‚ and the cause of his banish-
ment was only vaguely indicated bya complaint against the perni-
cious tendency of the Ars Amatoria, which had been published ten
years previous Had he been exiled at the time of its publication, it
might not have seemed extraordinary, since the poem tended directly
to subvert all those measures for the regulation of publicfmorals
which Augustus was taking singular pains to enforce; but Ovid was
never molested on the ground of the licentiousness of his writings
until an event occurred, which is now hidden in impenetrable mys·
tery, although it is evident that it was no secret at the time. This
event was the real ground of the banishment, for which the poem was
made the pretext.

It is much easier to show what the offence was not than what it
was “ It seems to have been of a nature which Augustus could not
venture to declare openly: had it been an offence against public mo·
rality, he would have claimed merit for making it the subject of a
