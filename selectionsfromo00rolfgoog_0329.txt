men proud oi their country, on better grounds than the mere glory¹
oi its arms and the extent oi its conquests. It would be absurd to ·
suppose that Virgil's verses iuduced any Roman to put his hand tp
the plough, or to take from his bailiii' the management oi his own
estatem but they served undoubtedly to revive some nithe simple
tutes and sentiments oi the olden time, and to perpetuate, amidst the
vices and corruptions oi the empire, a pure stream oi soher and inno-
cent enjoyments . . . . To comprehend the moral grandeur os the
Georgica, in point of style the most periect piece oi Roman literature,
we must regard it as the glorification oi Labor ..... On the labors
nithe husbandman, hard and coarse as they seem to the unpurged
vision, Virgil throws all the colors oi the radiant heaven oi the im·
agination. labor improbas, incessant, importunate labor, conquers
all things ς subdues the soil, baffles the inclemency os the seasons‚
deieats the machinations oi Nature, that cruel stepmother, and wins
the lavor and patronage oi the gods.” ⁴*

Theconciuding lines oi the Georgica were written at Naples (Georg-
IV. 559), but we can hardly inser that the whole poem was written
there, though this is tbe literal meaning oi the words,

We may however conclude that it was compieted after the battle oi
Actium, B. C. 31, while Caesar was in the East.

to have bad a strong desire oi composing an epic poem, and, like him
also, to have been long undecided on his subject. He is said to have
begun a metrical chronicle oi the Alban Kings, but afterwards to
have given it up because oi the harshness oi the names. Alter the
completion oi the Georgica or perhaps somevhat earlier, he laid
down'the plan oi a regular epic on the wanderings oi Aeneas, and
the Roman destinies 3 to form a sort of continuation oi the Iltbdrm
Rom times, and to combine the features oitbat poeni and the Odys-
rey. The idea was sufficiently noble, and the poem, long before its
publication or even conclusion. had obtained· the very highest repu-
