ECLOGUE 1. - TITYRUS.

'rna subject of this Eclogue is Virgil’s gratitudo to Octavianus lor
the favor shown him in the restoration oi his lande. See Life.

The speakers are two shepherds‚ one oi whom is enjoying. rustic
liic, singing oi his love, and seeing his cattle seed undisturbed‚ when
he is encountered hythe other, who has been expelled from his home·
stead, and is driving his goats before him, with no prospect but a
cheerless exile. This is simple enough, but it is complicated by an
unhappy artifice. The fortunate shepherd is represented as a sarm

used to symbolize the confirmation oi the poet in his property. The
two events, with their concomitante, are treated as convertible with
each other, the story being told partly in the one iorm, partly in the
other.
