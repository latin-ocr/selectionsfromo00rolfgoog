now so much desired by Dido, Juno devising a plan by which to bring

, it about (90-128). The queen proposesa hunting excursion, which

accordingly takes place3 but while all are earnest in the pursuit of
the game, a violent thunder·storm is sent down by Juno, causing the Ἰ
hunters to fly in different directions, Aeneas and Dido, however, ac·
cidentally take shelter in the same cave (129-172). Soon aster this
event Jupiter, roused by the remonstrances ol Iarbas, sends Mercury
to Aeneas with an authoritative command to leave Africa and make
lor Italy (173-278), which order the son of Venus prepares to obey

(279·295)· Dido immediately suspects the intentioris ol Aeneas, ’

and expostulares with him, but in vain (296 - 449) ; and, accordingly,
being unable to bear up against her grief, she determines to die (450-
473). Concealing her purpose from her sister, she erecte a huge pyre
and pretends¹ that it is intended for the celebration os magle cere-
monies,by which she may be enabled to shake off her affection sor
Aeneas and to sorget him altogether (474- 521). Her grief now in-

creases to lrenzy; but by this time Aeneas has weighed anchor, and '

stands out to sea in the middle ol the night (522 · 583). ‘In the mom·
ing Dido, maddened by the sight ol the Trojan ships in the distant
offing, breaks out in a paroxysm os lovesick sorrow, and imprecates
calamities on her once cherished guest (584-629); and having dis-
· missed all her attendants, she slays herself on the pyre (630- 705).
