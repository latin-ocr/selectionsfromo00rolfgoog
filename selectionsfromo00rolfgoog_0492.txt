honori. Scarcely any two commentators have agreed in respect to
the meaning of these words. Serv. supposes it to be, that Androm-
ache does not yield to the honor oi Ascanius, does not give him less
than his due. Heyne‚ that Andromache does not yield to the lib·
erality oi her husband. Wr., that chlamys is the subject of cedit: the
mantle does not yield to the beauty oi the other robes. Others have
adopted honore. Con. suggests another rendering, which, though quite
different from all the rest, we have aster sorne hesitation decided
to adopt: “nor does she flag in the work of honoring him” ; i. e.
give way to honor, as ii she were contending with ἤρα poetical
