THE AENEID. Boon V.

Iu the first half of the Aeneid it would almost seem as il Virgil had
intentionally relieved those portions of his narrative which possess
the most absorbing interest with others oi a more level and less
exeiting kind The detailed account ol the agonies ol the one night
of Troy’s capture was succeeded bya rapid sketch of the events of
seven years oltravel; and now we pass from the spectacle of Dido¹s
franfic love and (asa modern reader will regard it) Aeneas's faith-
lessness to a description ol the games celebrated by the Trojan hero
in Sicily on the anniversary of his father's death This serves to
conduct us from the tragedy of the Fourth Book to the mysterious
solemnities of the Sixth Aeneas does not pass at once srom the
temble cmflict of love and duty to the initiation which is reserved
for the chosen favorites of Heaven, but is shown to us as the pious
and beneficent prince, reverentially dutilul to his father’s memory,
and kind and liberal to his followers and friends, - encouraging the
ambition ol his own men and returning the courtesies of the Sicilians
by a display in which it is his honor to be the dispenser os honors to
others.

ARGUMENT.

Aeneas, leaving Carthage, sets sail lor Italy, but by the violence os
a tempest isa second time driven on the coast of Sicily, where, as·
sisted by Acestes, he celebrates games at the tomb ol lais father An·
chius, on the anniversary of his death (1-603). In the meantime
the Trojan women, instigated by Iris, the messenger os Juno, set fire
to the ships, of which four are burned, the others being miracu·

⁸ lously preserved by Jupiter (604-699). Anchises appears to Aeneas

in a vision on the following night, and gives him advice and direction
with regard to his future course (700- 740). Aeneas founds the town
of Acesta and leaves, as colonists, many ol the matrons, and the old
men unfit ior active service in war, and himself again puts to sea with
his fleet sor Latium (μί-778). In this voyage Neptune rendcrs the
sea propitious, and, at length, after his many wanderings, Aeneas
reaches Italy, having, however, lost his pilot Palinurus when near
the Hesperien coast (779- 871).
