THE GEORGICS. Book Ι.

Trrr name Georgica (Georgica) is Greek, Γεωργικᾶ, and means
“ agricultural affairs.” The title Georgr'cdn is 'the Greek genitive plu·
ral of georgica. The poem is divided into four books, oi which the
first treats os agriculture, the second, of the cultivation ol vines and
trees, the third, ol raising cattle, and the fourth, of the management
of bees. For a history os the Georgics, see the Life of Wrgr'l.

The subject of the First Book is the tillage os the ground witha
view to crepe, chiefly corn. The mention os the uncertainty of the
mther at different times os the year leads the poet to give a list of
the signs of a storm and os sair weather, which he abridges from the
Diosemeth os Aratus. From this he passes to the signs os the polit·
ical storm which had broken over Rome, and shows that extemal
nature had been no less eloquent there, while he prays that Octavi·
anus Caesar may yet be spared to save society.
