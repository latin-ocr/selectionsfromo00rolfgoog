public arraignment. Though the sufferer bows to his sentence, and
acquiesces discreetly in the charge which he knows to be fictitious,
hie allusions point plainly to some other cause, well known to Augus·
tus and himself, the possession apparently, and possibly, as he pro·
rests, the innocent possession of some fatal secret The conjectures
which have been made regarding it may be readily dismissed as
groundless . . . . It seems natural to surmise that Ovid, though no
public man himself, got unwittingly implicated in the political tnss
trigues of the time, and suffered as an accomplice in projects, of the
scope of which he was perhaps actually unconscious.”* ⁴

After a night of inexpressible distress, which the poet could never
recall without tears, a night spent in taking leave of his wife and of
two friends who remained with him to the last, (his daughter was in
Africa) by early morning he was afloat on atempestuous sea, the
gloomy image of his future life on the Getic coast. It was nearlya
year before he reached Tomi; but he beguiled the time by writing,
sereni of his pieces having been written on shipboard.

“From the scene of his punishment, on the verge of the inhospi-
table Dobrudscha, dreary and pestilential now, but then alternating
the frosts of the Neva with the fevers of the Niger, the wretched vic·
tim poured forth his misery in verses of grace and sweetness, though
of little power: he murmured at the loss of every friend and amuse-
ment, at the rudeness of the people, and hostility of their savage
neighbors, while he shuddered at the sight of the frozen Euxine, or
chivered in the agues of the Danubian marshes. A gleam of reviving
cheerfulness induced him at more favorable moments to cultivate the
hospitality of the natives, and to flatter thern by cultivating their lan·
guage, and even writing verses in it; but neither lamentations nor
industry availed to soothe the bitterness of his sorrows, which were
only for a moment allayed by anticipations of future celebrity; and he
continued in vain to solicit with abject humiliation the compassion of
the offended emperor. Though his punishment was not strictly
exile (exilium), but only the milder form of relegation (relegatio), which
allowed him to retain his fortune and his citizenship, and admitted
the hope of eventual pardon, he never obtained remission of his sen-
tence, though he survived Augustus three years.”†

· Ovid died, A. ι). 18, in the sixtieth year of his age, and the tenth of
his exile. His constitution, never robust, gradually gave way under
' the burden of his⁸sorrows The severity of the climate, the want of
home comforts and of good medical advice, doubtless hastened his
decline 3 but it is probable that this last chapter of the sad storyis

briefly comprehended in the simple words of one of his biographers:
“he died of a broken heart”
