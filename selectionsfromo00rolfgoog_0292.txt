582-691.] Pentheus, king of Thebes, was the son of Echion and
Agave, daughter of Cadmus. He endeavored to prevent his sub·
jects from paying divine honors to Bacchus ; and, while the Theban
women were celebrating the orgies of the god, he ordered his ser·
vants to seize the pretended deity and bring· him before him. They
cannot find Bacchus, but return with Acoetes, one of his priests.
Pentheus is enraged, and threatens to kill Acoetes, but bids him
first tell his story; which he does in the extract here given.
