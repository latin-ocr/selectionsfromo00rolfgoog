METAMORPHOSES. Boou X. ,

THE STORY OF ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.-Orpheus
was the son of Oeagrus, king of Thrace, and the Muse Calliope.
Hesented with the lyre by Apollo, and instructed by the Muses in its
use, he enchanted with its music not only the wild beasts, but the

very trees and rocks, which moved from their places to follow the y
