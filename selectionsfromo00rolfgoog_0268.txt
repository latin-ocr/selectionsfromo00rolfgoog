The works of Ovid up to the tirne ο1 his exile have already been
enumerated To these are to be added the five books of elegieo
called Tristia, written during the first four years of his banishment,
and the four books of Epistolae ex Ponto, written subsequently, in the
same measure as the Tristia, and, like that work, made up of descrip-
110113 01 his afflicted condition and petitions forrnercy. There is also
a satirical poem called Ibis, written in exile, and several other pieces,
whose genuineness is more or less doubtful. Of the twelve books of
the Fasti, only six have come down to us, and some have thought
that only six were ever written. The Metamorphoses, which the poet
burnt on going into exile, was complete in its plan, though it had not
received its last touches, and copies of it were already in the hands
of friends, through whom it was preserved.

“If Ovid, as aman, was unfortunate, as 3 poet he cannot be alto·
gether so regarded. He was born at the happiest time 101 the exhi·
bition of his chief excellence, skill in the mechanical structure of 1113
language. Even in the Julian Age he would scarcely have developed
this, nor, 11 he had, would it have been duly appreciated; 3111111113-
diately after his decease a new school had arisen Of the mutual
adaptation of his time and his genius he was fully sensible; and he
made good use of his opportunities. When we speak, however, of
Ovid‘s elegance as his principal distinction, it is only because his suc·
cess in this respect is so transcendent. He was, in imaginative power,
perhaps, superior to all other Latin poets; and Milton hesitates not

to affirm, that, but for the influenc'e of misfortune on his genius, he '

would have surpassed Virgil in epic achiev'ement The Metamor-
phoses, though in part indebted to Greek originals for form and 111313·
1131, 313 yet 3 marvellous work 01 fancy. Some of the stories are
exuberant with creative force ; and the subtle thread which connects
the diverse materials in one harmonious and beautiful whole is not
less admirable than the structure itself. . . . . Ovid was the only
writer of eminence who prolonged the golden age of Latin poetry be·
yond the time of Horace.'’ ⁴*

“His various compositions,” says another writer, from whom we

have already quoted, “comprehend many pieces 01 unsullied purity
and grace, which are still the first pages of antiquity we put into the
hands of our children, and among the last on which we turn the retro·
spect of our own declining years ..... Η13 amatory poems were
principally the work of his earlier years, and the mathrity of 1113 powers
was devoted sedulously, nor with less felicity, to subjects of wider
scope and higher interest.''l
