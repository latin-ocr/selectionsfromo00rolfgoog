, Arx is here used in its proper sense, a citadel, or point of defence,
though priam seems to show that the word is not meant to be re·
stricted to Pergamus. See on I. 1. Aeneas sees Panthus hurrying
away from the citadel with his gods and his grandson, and so naturally
asks, “What citadel are we occupyingi” or “have we occupied?”
( prendimus may be either pres. or perf.) suspecting already that
Pergamus is no longer tenable. Henry well remarks that Panthus
answers in etl'ect, “We have no citadel anywhere to defeud,” and
that Aeneas, hearing this, rushes out with no definite object in the .
direction of the shouting. Panthu Gr. 462 3. 5). Α. u S. 545
