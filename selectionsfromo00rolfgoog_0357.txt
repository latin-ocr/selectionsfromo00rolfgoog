ECLOGUE IX. - MOERIS.

Tire historical occasion of this Eclogue has been already adverted
to in the Life os Virgil. After obtaining a promise of protection, the
poet is said to have returned to his property, when his entrance was
resisted and his life menaced by an intruding soldier, whose name is

variously given asArrius, Claudius, or Milienus Toto. He sought ,

safety in flight, and made a second appeal to the higher authorities,
which was crowned with more permanent success, Ruaeus conjec-
tures that this Eclogue was in fact a poetical petition presented to
Varus or Octavianus. Certainly it is skilfully contrived to interest
the reader in the poet‘s favor. Moeris, one of the servants, is going
to the town (Mantua), to carry partos the farm produce to the usurp·
ing proprietor, when he is stopped by a neighbor, LycidaS, relates his
and his master's troubles, and receives a warrn expression of sym·
pathy at the loss which had so nearly fallen on the whole district by
the death of Menalcas (Virgil), some of the poet’s verses being quoted
to show how great that loss would have been, while it is hinted that
his successful return will produce further poems.

1. Pedes, sc. ducunt. - 2. vivi pervenimus =we have lived
to see, have reached the point alive; vivi expressing both that they
might have expected to die before such an outrage, and also that
dea'th would have been a boon. Advena; used contemptuously, as
in A. IV. 591. Nostri . . . agelli= of our (ie. of my) land; slaves
then, as now, speaking of their master‘s property as their own. The
involved order of the words seems to indicate the perturbation of
Moeris. - ³. Ut relates to an omitted eo, implied in urbi pervenimus
