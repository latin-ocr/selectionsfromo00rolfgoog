ferring not exclusively to the cave of the winds, but generally to the
niret rocky Aeolia, where the winds had their home, where the caue
of the winds was. -140. Vestrast referring to the whole company,
though only one is named. ma...in aule. Illa plainly refers
aulo to immunia saxu and vestras domos ,¹ therefore the aetla (or court),
in which Aeolus is here told to display his power (se jactet), is neither
the celsa arx of v. 56, nor ‘⁴ the cavern of the winds,'’ but simply the
country of Aeolia—141. clauso-carcere. Gr. 431. A. dr S.
257. Clauso is emphatic. Let him close the prison of the winds, and
then let him reign absolute. This is Henry’s interpretation, and just
the opposite of the common one, viz. let him reign absolute in tho
closed prison of the winds; but it is preferred for three reasons t rst,
the command thus interpreted is compatible with the dignity of Nep·
tune; ad, imperatively required by the circumstances of the casn
3d, in perfect harmony with the delegated authority of Aeolus, who
might be as despotic as he pleased among the immania saxa of Aeo
lia, provided only he did not open or shut the prison of the winds
without orders: cf. jussus, v. 63. -142 Dicto citium i. e. before

-148-156. This simile is remarkable as an illustration of Nature
from man, the reverse of which is the general rule in Virg. as in Ho-
mer. The image was no doubt suggested by the riots in the Roman
forum during the political contests of the later republic. Itis an in·
stance ofa simile where the construction of the sentence is fully
drawn out. Ac couples the whole with what has gone before. The
apodosis to veluti is sic (v. 154) ; that to quum would seem to be tum
(v. 151), as it is there that the point of the simile is introduced. -148.
