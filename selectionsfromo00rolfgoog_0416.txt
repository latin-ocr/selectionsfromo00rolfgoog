The genuineness of these verses is doubtful. By Burmann, Peerl-
kamp, Heyne, and many other commentators they are condemned as
unworthy of the genius os Virgil, and inconsistent with the dignity of
epic poetry, and are assigned to some unknown grammarian ; but Wr.„
Forb., Henry‚ and others, regard them as genuine, and byrro meanh
devoid of terseness and elegance. Wr. does not, however, suppose
them to have formed originally the beginning of the Aeneid, hut to
have been prefixed, as an fmcription, to a few copies of the first book,
which the poet circulated among private friends, as a sample of the
whole. They appear to have existed in the time of Servius and Do
natus, who say that Nisus the grammarian had heard a story of their
having been expunged by Tucca and Varius, to whom, after Virgilk
death, tlre revision of the Aeneid, preparatory to publication, was in·
trusted. See life.

They may be translated thus: l (arn) that (poet), who formerly
tuned a lay on a slender reedpipe (E. 1. 2), and, having gone forth
from the woods (i. e. having abandoned pastoral poetryh taught (i. e.
in tlte Georgics) the neighboring fields to obey the husbandman, how·
ever eager (for harvests),—a work acceptable to cultivators os the

have found a difficulty in reconciling primus with Antenor’s previous
migration (below, vv. 242 foll), and suggest that Aeneas haid first
reached Italy proper, though Antenor had previously reached Ve-
jnetia On the other hand, Heyne and Wr. make primus equivalent
'to olim, thus weakening a word which from its position and its occur·
rence in the first line ol the poem must be emphatic. The more ob·
vious sense is that Aeneas is so called without reference to Antenor,
