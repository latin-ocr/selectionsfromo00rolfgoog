ARGUMENT.

susas having landed at Cumae, immediately seeks e-. ,..,

me Sibyl, and consults the oracle: from it he learns some particulare “

ol his dangers and further labors (1 - 155). He performs funeral rites
to the body of Misenus ς and while engaged in the preparations lor
this ceremouy, discovers the golden bough, which, as a gift to Proser-
pina, would gain t'or him permission to pass to the Elysian shades, to
meet and converse with his father Anchises. Provided with it and
accompanied by the'Siby1‚ he reaches the entrance to the infernal
regions (r 56- 336). On the hither side os the Styx he meets with the
shade ol his quondam pilot Palinurus, and aiter receiving from him a
detailed account ol the circumstances attending his death, he promises
to perform to him the due obsequies on his return to earth, and to
erect a cenotaph (337-383). Crossing the Styx, he traverses the dis·
trict occupied by the spirits of infants, and of those who had been
unjustly put to death, and enters that where wander in solitude ill-
requited lovem, -their own murderers. In this latter place he falls
in with Dido, who, however, indignantly declines a conversation (384-
476). In the region ol' slain warriors, Deiphobus, among others, pre·
sents himself, all mangled as he was (477- 534). He passes Tartarus
on the right, and is instructed by the Sibyl in all the varieties ol pun·
tshment, which were inflicted on the grossly wicked in the abode set
apart lor them (535-627). He next reaches the palace of Dis, and,
having sured the golden bough on the entrance, directs his course to
the habitations ol the blessed, and, under the guidance ol Musaeus,
at length finds Anchises (628-678). Having lully discoursed on the
nature os the soul, its purification, and the processes necessary to
bring about final perlection, Anchises lays brielly before Aeneas the
history ol the Roman empire, which his posterity are to found (679-
888). On the conclusion os the interview our hero and his guide
ascend to earth again through the ivory gete, the Sibyl departing
to her cave, and Aeneas to his fleet, which he moors at Caieta
