THE AENEID. Boon VI.

Tim celebrity oi the Sixth Book os the Aeneid is one os those broad
and acknowledged facts before which minute criticism is almost pow-
erless. There is indeed no part ol the work which more completely
exemplifies the characteristioe of Virgil as a poetical artist. He ap-
pears not only to reproduce Homer, but to absorb him. Aeneas sees
all, or nearly all, that Ulysses sees, - his parent, his friends, his ene-
rnies, and the heroes and heroines os previous legend: buthe sees
much more besides. Instead os a place oi simply‘ghostly existence,
where suffering and doing seem to be the exceptione, and dreary, ob·
jectless being the rule, we have a territory mapped out and sharply
divided‚ - a neutral region sor those who are unfortunate rather than
blameworthy, a barred and bolted prison-house of tortore ior the bad,
a heroic Valhalla sor prowess, genius, and worth All that later Greek
religion and philosophy taught by legend, allegory, and symbol, is

pressed into the service os poetry‚ and made to contribute to the pro· '

duction of a grand and impressive picture. As a climax to the whole,
the Pythagorean doctrine or' transmigration is invoked for the purpose
of showing Aeneas the vision os the future, as he has already seen
the vision of the past He beholds the spirits that are to appear
as actors in the great drama os Roman history, each even now wear-
ing his historical form ; and the line os worthies ends with the young
hope ol the nation, whose untimely death was still fresh in the mem-
ory olhiscountryrnen when the poet wrote. ’
