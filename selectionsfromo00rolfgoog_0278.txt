His divine origin having been called in question by Epaphus, the son
of Jupiter and Io, he appeals to his mother, who, after assuring him
that he is the son of Phoebus, advises him to go to the god himself
for prooi of the truth of her story. He sets out at once, and Ovid

Greek Hephaistos, son ol Jupiter and Juno, or, according to later

out of heaven, and after falling awhole day, he alighted on the island
of Lemnos, which became his favorite abode. Other volcanic islands
also, as Lipara, imbros, and Sicily, are called his abodes, or work·
shops. Homer places his workshop in a splendid palace on Olym-
pus. The palaces of all the gods were built hy him, and the ancient
poete abound in descriptions of marvellous and beautiful things which
he made for gods and men. -The ancients derived the name Mulci-
ber from mulcere, to sosten, and serrum, irou. - 6. Caelarat* Gr.
