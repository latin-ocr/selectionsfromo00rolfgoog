THE niun oF ovm.

In the Tenth Elegy of the Fourth Book of his Tristia, our poet has

himself givenusaminute account of his life 3ηά fortunes. In other ·

poems, he osten speaks of himself, so that there are few writers of
ancient times with whose history we are better acquainted. Several
biographies of him have come down to us; but they add little of im·
portance to what we thus leam from his own writings.

Puumus Ovinius Naso was born of an ancient and noble family,
at Sulmo (now Sulmonal, in the country of the Peligni, March 20,
Β. c. 43. At 'an early age, he was sent to Rome to be educated, and
studied with some of the most eminent teachers of the day, among
whom he mentions Arellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro He was de-
signed by his father for the bar, 3ηά seems to have made commend)
able proficiency in the preliminary studies of the profession. The
elder Seneca speaks highly of his declamations, 3ηά has preserved an
extract from one of them. He remarks, however, that Ovid’s oratory
resembled a selmum carmen, and Ovid himself tells us that whatever
he attempted to write took the form of verse ponte sua. His father
endeavored to wean him from this tendency' to poetical pursuits, warn-
ing him that poetry was the direct road to poverty; but, aster a brief
struggle against the ruling passion, he yielded to his destiny, aban-
doned the profession for which he was intended, and devoted himself
to the service of the Muses. He mentions several of the leading
poets of the day as among the number of his friends at this time,
Macer, Propertius, Bassus, and Horace. Virgil and Tibullus, both
of whom died when he was but twenty-four, he knew less intimately.
He seems to have been mo'st familiar with Propertius, who, like him·
self, had relinquished forensic for poetica} pursuits, and who occa·
sionally read to him his elegies, which naturally excited the admira·
tion and the emulation of the youthful listener. Ovid, like Proper·
tius, had attempted epic poetry; but the failure of his friend in this
species of writing, and his brilliant success in elegy, appear to have
determined his own hesitating muse. His first published work, the
Amores, was the result, and the favor with which it was received en·
couraged him to persevere in the career on which he had entered.
