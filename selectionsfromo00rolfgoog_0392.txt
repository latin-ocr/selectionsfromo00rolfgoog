THE GEORGICS. Boon ΙΙ.

THE main subject ol the Second Book is the culture ol trees,
especially the vine. But there is no great regularity in the mode
ol treatment. Virgil opens with an enumeration oi the different ways
of propagating trees, natural and artificial, so as to give some notion
of the magnitude oi the theme; theu shows how art can inrprove
upon nature, aad recurs again to the manilolduess ol his subject,
dwelling especially on the innumerable varieties ol vines. Without
much relevancy he talks of the trees which are indigenous to different
countries, and thence digresses into a eulogy ol Italy, which he does
not fit with any practical application. The question ol the aptitudes
ol various soils is treated sar more widely than the subject of the
book requires, embracing the choice of corn aud pasture land, as
well as oi ground lor planting vines and other trees. For the next
160 lines the poet seems to be thinking exclusively oi the vine, or os
the trees planted in the arbustum as its supporters. He does not
distinguish between the different modes of rearing the vine, but in
general appears to assume that the arbustum will be the means
adopted. He speaks ol the vine and its supporters almost indiffer-
ently‚ as objects more or less ol the same culture, so that, while
keeping the former prominently belore him, he seels himself at liberty
to use general language, or even to confine his language to the latter,
as metrical convenience or poetical variety may suggest3 a manner
of speaking which renders this part ol the book peculiarly difficult.
The olive, which was put prominently iorward in the programme ol
the book, is actually disposed os in a very few lines, as requiring
hardly any culture at all, while the other fruit-trees are dismissed
even more brielly. The remaining trees receive avery hasty recom-
mendatiou to the cultivator, backed however with an assurance that
they are even more useiul to man than the vine. In the celebrated
digression which concludes the book, the laborious aspect ol a

. country lile, elsewhere so prominent, is studiously kept out ol sight,

Ἴ and we hear only ol eas'e, enjoyment‚ and plenty.

The beauties of this book have always been admired, and deserv·
edly so. They are most conspicuous in the digressions3 but the
more strictly didactic part contains innumerable felicities of expres·
sion, though it may be doubted whether in general they do not ob·
scure the practical meaning as much as they illustrate it.
