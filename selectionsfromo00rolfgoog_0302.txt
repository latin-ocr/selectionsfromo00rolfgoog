norides. Most of the editors speak os Agenor as the great-grand·
lather os Perseus ς but according to the best authorities, Perseus was
descended from Belus, the min-brother os Agenor. His mother, Danae,
was the daughter of Acrisius, the sonos Abas, the son of Lynceus and
Hypermnestra, the former of whom was the sonos Aegyptus, the latter
the daughter of Dan'a'u53 and Aegyptus and Danaus were twin sons of
Belus. See on v. 607. Some read Abantiades instead of Agenorides ,-
some think the inaccuracy a slip of the pen which Ovid would hare
corrected, had he revised the poem. See Life. Perhaps gelido
sub Atlante is another slip of the kind. Atlas had been changed to
stone before this time, it is true, but so recently that Perseus would
hardly speak of him as a well-known mountain, especially in relating
events that had taken place previous to his transformation. -773,
